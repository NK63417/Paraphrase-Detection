# Paraphrase-Detection

In natural language processing (NLP), paraphrase
detection is an essential task that has applications in text
summarization, information retrieval, and question answering.
Although transformer-based models have shown state-of-the-art
performance in several NLP tasks, adding graph attention
mechanisms offers a chance to improve even further. In this
paper, we offer a unique method for paraphrase identification
that blends graph attention networks with transformer-based
sequence classification. By focusing on the graph-structured
interactions between input tokens, our model learns useful
representations by utilizing the power of pre-trained transformer
architectures. We conduct experiments on the MRPC dataset
from the GLUE benchmark to show how effective our strategy is
in comparison to baseline techniques. Our findings demonstrate
that the addition of graph attention enhances paraphrase
identification accuracy, leading to competitive results on test and
validation sets. We also present a thorough study of the behavior
of the model and talk about possible directions for further
research. Our results demonstrate the potential to improve NLP
tasks, especially in the paraphrase detection domain, by fusing
transformer-based models with graph attention methods.
